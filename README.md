# Biodiversity-in-National-Parks

The following datasets can be found in the data file:

species_info.csv: contains data about different species and their conservation status

observations.csv: holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days

To view my analysis, you can open the Excel file.

The data for this project is inspired by real data but its mostly fictional.
